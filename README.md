Made it outta the hood yo

I faced alot of difficulties during my strenous journey of enlightinment. I understand flexbox. Woooooo!
Here are some stuff I learned:
-To make flex container occupy the whole screen I will have to use : height: 100vh;
- I circle is squeezed due to flexbox, use min-height instead of height when making circle
